  var0="You have brains in your head.You have feet in your shoes.<br>You can steer yourself in any direction you choose.<br>You're on your own, and you know what you know.<br>And you are the guy who'll decide where to go."
  var1="Today you are you! That is truer than true!<br>There is no one alive who is you-er than you!"
  var2="Don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened."
  var3="The more that you read, the more things you will know.<br>The more that you learn, the more places you'll go." 
  var4="Step with care and great tact,<br>and remember that Life's a Great Balancing Act."
  var5="How did it get so late so soon? Its night before its afternoon.<br>December is here before its June.<br>My goodness how the time has flewn. How did it get so late so soon?"
  var6="A person's a person, no matter how small."
  var7="Think left and think right and think low and think high.<br>Oh, the thinks you can think up if only you try!"
  var8="I like nonsense; it wakes up the brain cells."
  var9="You're never too old, too wacky, too wild, to pick up a book and read to a child." 
  var10="Today was good. Today was fun. Tomorrow is another one."
  var11="Only you can control your future."
  var12="Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,<br>nothing is going to get better. It's not."
  var13="From there to here, and here to there, funny things are everywhere."
  var14="Adults are obsolete children."
  var15="The main problem with writing in verse is, if your fourth line doesn't come out right,<br> you've got to throw four lines away and figure out a whole new way to attack the problem.<br> So the mortality rate is terrific."
  var16="Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living,<br>it's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope,<br>and that enables you to laugh at life's realities."
